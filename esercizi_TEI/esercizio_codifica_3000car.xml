                <p n="1">
                    <lb n="1"/>
                    Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle
                    <lb n="2"/>
                    Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer’s wife. Their
                    <lb n="3"/>
                    house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon
                    <lb n="4"/>
                    many miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one
                    <lb n="5"/>
                    room; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for
                    <lb n="6"/>
                    the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry
                    <lb n="7"/>
                    and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in
                    <lb n="8"/>
                    another corner. There was no garret at all, and no cellar—except a
                    <lb n="9"/>
                    small hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family
                    <lb n="10"/>
                    could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to
                    <lb n="11"/>
                    crush any building in its path. It was reached by a trap door in the
                    <lb n="12"/>
                    middle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark
                    <lb n="13"/>
                    hole.
                </p>

                
                <p n="2">
                    <lb n="14"/>
                    When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see
                    <lb n="15"/>
                    nothing but the great gray prairie on every side. Not a tree nor a
                    <lb n="16"/>
                    house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of
                    <lb n="17"/>
                    the sky in all directions. The sun had baked the plowed land into a
                    <lb n="18"/>
                    gray mass, with little cracks running through it. Even the grass was
                    <lb n="19"/>
                    not green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until
                    <lb n="20"/>
                    they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere. Once the house had
                    <lb n="21"/>
                    been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it
                    <lb n="22"/>
                    away, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.
                </p>
                
                <p n="3">
                    <lb n="23"/>
                    When Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife. The sun
                    <lb n="24"/>
                    and wind had changed her, too. They had taken the sparkle from her eyes
                    <lb n="25"/>
                    and left them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks and
                    <lb n="26"/>
                    lips, and they were gray also. She was thin and gaunt, and never smiled
                    <lb n="27"/>
                    now. When Dorothy, who was an orphan, first came to her, Aunt Em had
                    <lb n="28"/>
                    been so startled by the child’s laughter that she would scream and
                    <lb n="29"/>
                    press her hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy’s merry voice reached
                    <lb n="30"/>
                    her ears; and she still looked at the little girl with wonder that she
                    <lb n="31"/>
                    could find anything to laugh at.
                </p>

                <p n="4">
                    <lb n="32"/>
                    Uncle Henry never laughed. He worked hard from morning till night and
                    <lb n="33"/>
                    did not know what joy was. He was gray also, from his long beard to his
                    <lb n="34"/>
                    rough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.
                </p>

                <p n="5">
                    <lb n="35"/>
                    It was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as gray
                    <lb n="36"/>
                    as her other surroundings. Toto was not gray; he was a little black
                    <lb n="37"/>
                    dog, with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on
                    <lb n="38"/>
                    either side of his funny, wee nose. Toto played all day long, and
                    <lb n="39"/>
                    Dorothy played with him, and loved him dearly.
                </p>

                <p n="6">
                    <lb n="40"/>
                    Today, however, they were not playing. Uncle Henry sat upon the
                    <lb n="41"/>
                    doorstep and looked anxiously at the sky, which was even grayer than
                    <lb n="42"/>
                    usual. Dorothy stood in the door with Toto in her arms, and looked at
                    <lb n="43"/>
                    the sky too. Aunt Em was washing the dishes.
                </p>

                <p n="7">
                    <lb n="44"/>
                    From the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry
                    <lb n="45"/>
                    and Dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the
                    <lb n="46"/>
                    coming storm. There now came a sharp whistling in the air from the
                    <lb n="47"/>
                    south, and as they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the
                    <lb n="48"/>
                    grass coming from that direction also.
                </p>

                <p n="8">
                    <lb n="49"/>
                    Suddenly Uncle Henry stood up.
                </p>

                <p n="9">
                    <lb n="50"/>
                    <q>“There’s a cyclone coming, Em,”</q> he called to his wife. <q>“I’ll go look
                    <lb n="51"/>
                    after the stock.”</q> Then he ran toward the sheds where the cows and
                    <lb n="52"/>
                    horses were kept.
                </p>
                    
                <p n="10">
                    <lb n="53"/>
                    Aunt Em dropped her work and came to the door. One glance told her of
                    <lb n="54"/>
                    the danger close at hand.
                </p>
                
                <p n="11">
                    <lb n="55"/>
                    <q>“Quick, Dorothy!”</q> she screamed. <q>“Run for the cellar!”</q>
                </p>
